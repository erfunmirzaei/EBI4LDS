## Introduction

In this paper, we propose a new empirical Bernstein inequality for dependent data in Hilbert spaces. The inequality provides a powerful tool for analyzing the concentration of empirical means and other statistics in dependent data settings. This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the experiments and results presented in the paper.
